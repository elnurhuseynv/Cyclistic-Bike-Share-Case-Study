# R Analysis – Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study

## Purpose
This folder contains the R-based analysis for the Cyclistic Bike-Share case study.
R was used for data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, and visualization.

## Tools & Libraries
- R
- tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2, lubridate)
- readr

## Script Overview

### Data_Process.R
- Imports raw CSV files
- Standardizes column names
- Merges quarterly datasets
- Cleans trip duration data
- Removes invalid rides (1–1440 minutes)
- Creates time-based features (weekday, month, hour)

### Data_Analysis.R
- Calculates summary statistics by user type
- Compares ride duration patterns
- Analyzes usage by weekday, month, and hour

### Data_Visualization.R
- Creates boxplots for ride duration
- Creates bar charts for weekday usage
- Creates line charts for hourly and monthly trends
- Saves all plots to the Outputs folder

## Key Findings (R)
- Casual riders take significantly longer trips on average
- Subscribers ride more frequently with shorter durations
- Subscriber usage peaks during weekday commute hours
- Casual usage increases on weekends and midday

## Outputs
All charts and summary tables generated by R are saved in the `Outputs/` directory
and reused in SQL validation and Excel dashboards.
