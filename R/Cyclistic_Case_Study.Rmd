# 2. Data (Prepare)

I used publicly available Divvy bike-share trip data from 2019 Q1–Q4. Click here [link](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

**Data characteristics:**

* Anonymized trip-level data
* No personally identifiable information (PII)
* Contains system tests and outliers that require cleaning

---

# 3. Data Processing (Process)

**Data cleaning steps performed in R:**

* Standardized column names across files
* Combined quarterly datasets into full-year 2019
* Converted trip duration from seconds to minutes
* Removed invalid rides (duration < 1 minute or > 1440 minutes)
* Created time-based features (weekday, month, hour)

# 4. Analysis (Analyze)

This section summarizes the key behavioral differences between Customer (casual riders) and Subscriber (annual members).

### 4.1 Key metrics by rider type

```{r summary-table, echo=FALSE}
summary_table <- read_csv(file.path("Outputs/Summary_Table.csv"))
summary_table
```

### 4.2 Main findings

* **Casual riders** have longer ride durations on average (likely leisure use).
* **Members** have shorter ride durations and significantly more rides (likely commuting / frequent utility trips).

# 5. Visualizations (Share)

Below are the supporting charts created in R and saved to the Outputs folder.

### 5.1 Ride duration

```{r ride-duration, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("Outputs/Ride_Duration.png"))
```

### 5.2 Rides by weekday

```{r rides-weekday, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("Outputs/Rides_By_Weekday.png"))
```

### 5.3 Rides by hour

```{r rides-hour, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("Outputs/Rides_By_Hour.png"))
```

### 5.4 Rides by month

```{r rides-month, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("Outputs/Rides_By_Month.png"))
```

# 6. Recommendations (Act)

**Based on the analysis:**

1. **Weekend conversion campaigns:** Target casual riders on weekends with membership promotions emphasizing savings after multiple rides.

2. **Station-based targeting:** Focus digital ads and on-site messaging at stations with the highest casual usage.

3. **Commute messaging for frequent riders:** Promote membership benefits for riders who show repeated weekday usage patterns (e.g., morning/evening peaks).
